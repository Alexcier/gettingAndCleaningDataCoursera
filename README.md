# gettingAndCleaningDataCoursera

#the datasource is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

#This code assumes that the uci har dataset is present in the home directory

#CodeBook.md describes the variables, datasets and transformations

#run_analysis.R transforms the dataset into the necessary structures creating two seperate datasets ("merged data" and "merged_data_averages"), both of which are present within this repo

#The code is designed to be run sequentially
